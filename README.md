## Reflection

### What went well:
**Design:** The game looked similar to what I have imagined and it was really fun to design the cat character and the spritesheets.
**Core Mechanics:** The delayed jumping was not planned but made the game more interesting.

### Challenges:
**Thinking like a computer:** Thinking how I could program something to get to the working code was really hard.
**Time:** Dividing tasks to finish on time and implementing the different features within the time frame was not that easy troughout both weeks.

### Achievements:
**Understanding:** Thinking how to program something is now easier, because I had to learn it in a short time to progress with my game. I also gained a better understanding of my code.
